# Student Management System (SMS) Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript


1 Introduction

A Student Management System (SMS) is a tool designed to manage and organize student data efficiently.

It helps in storing, editing, updating, and deleting student information like name, grade, GPA, age, and section.

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend-only functionality.

2. Importance

Reduces manual work and paperwork.

Ensures organized and structured data storage.

Makes information retrieval fast and error-free.

Improves data accuracy and consistency.

3. Uses

Can be used in schools, colleges, and educational institutions.

Helps teachers and administrators track student performance.

Useful for small institutes needing a simple digital record system.

Can be the foundation for larger systems (with backend integration).

4. Features

Add new student records.

View all stored student records in a table.

Update existing student information.

Delete student records.

User-friendly interface.

Real-time data manipulation using JavaScript.

5. Technologies Used

HTML – for structuring the webpage.

CSS – for styling and layout.

JavaScript – for dynamic functionalities like adding, editing, deleting.

6. Method / Working Process

User fills the form with student data (Name, Grade, GPA, Age, Section).

On submission, the data is stored temporarily in an array.

The table below displays all added records dynamically.

Edit and Delete buttons allow modifying or removing data in real-time.

(Optional) localStorage can be added to store data persistently.

7. Advantages

Simple and easy to use.

Does not require server or database for basic use.

Can be enhanced with more fields or validation rules.

Mobile-friendly and responsive.

8. Limitations

Data is lost on refresh unless localStorage or backend is added.

No authentication or user management.

Not suitable for large-scale data handling without backend support.

9. Future Scope

Integrate with a backend (like Firebase, Node.js + MongoDB) for persistent storage.

Add authentication and user roles (Admin/Teacher).

Export data to PDF or Excel.

Search and filter functionalities.

Dashboard with statistics (average GPA, students per section, etc.).

10. Conclusion

This Student Management System demonstrates the practical use of web technologies.

It simplifies student data handling and showcases the basics of CRUD operations.

It’s a great foundation project for learning frontend development and can be scaled further with backend and database integration.
